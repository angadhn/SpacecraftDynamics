    "1. __Recommended option__: online access as provided by universities e.g., [QMUL](https://jhub.sems.qmul.ac.uk) offers one to its students; or\n",
    "2. __Advanced and adventurous option__: by installing [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) on your personal computer and accessing the Jupyter notebook interface. Instructions on using Jupyter notebooks with Anaconda can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/ae-notebooks/user-guide/basic-tasks/apps/jupyter/index.html).\n",

This contrasts with your standard hand-held calculator, which performs computations on scalar quantities.\n",

    "is the representation of a vector ${\\bf v}$ using the scalars $v_i$ $(i=1,2,3)$\n",
