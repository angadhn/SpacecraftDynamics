    "# Introduction to $\\LaTeX$ or \"Why $\\LaTeX$ is Amazing for Engineering Students\"\n",
    "Let me introduce $\\LaTeX$ in a friendly way:\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to write a beautiful document with complex math equations,\n",
    "but instead of fighting with formatting like you do in Microsoft Word, you're\n",
    "more like a composer writing a musical score. That's $\\LaTeX$ (pronounced \"Lay-tech\" or \"Lah-tech\")!\n",
    "It's a way of writing documents where you focus on the content, and the computer\n",
    "handles making everything look perfect and beautiful. $\\LaTeX$ was created by computer\n",
    "scientist [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) because he was\n",
    "frustrated with how mathematical texts looked in regular word processors. Today, it's\n",
    "the go-to choice for scientists, engineers, and mathematicians worldwide. While it\n",
    "might seem a bit different at first (kind of like learning to ride a bike), once you\n",
    "get the hang of it, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Now, you may well say\n",
    "that you arn't typing documents yet so a [little later](content:handwriting-math) I\n",
    "also tell you why it is far superior in your exams to explain your work than merely\n",
    "submitting handwritten documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Gentle Introduction Commands\n",
    "Instead of clicking buttons to make text bold or italicize a heading, you write simple\n",
    "commands like `\\bold{I love spacecraft dynamics}` or `\\textit{My Project}`, and\n",
    "$\\LaTeX$ takes care of making it look great. These examples would look like this:\n",
    "- $\\bold{I love spacecraft dynamics}$\n",
    "- $\\textit{My Project}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this page, I will briefly introduce you to the basics of $\\LaTeX$ and how it can be used to explain your\n",
    "thinking in the context of the coursework project and final exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of clicking buttons to make text bold or center a heading, you write simple\n",
    "commands like `\\bold{text}` or `\\title{My Project}`, and $\\LaTeX$ takes care of\n",
    "making it look great. These examples would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\bold{text}$\n",
    "- $\\title{My Project}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The real magic of $\\LaTeX$ shines when it comes to math. Rather than struggling with\n",
    "Word's equation editor, you can write something like `$E = mc^2$`, and $\\LaTeX$ transforms\n",
    "it into a beautifully typeset equation that looks like it belongs in a textbook.\n",
    "In this case, it would look like this: $E = mc^2$. It's like having a professional\n",
    "typesetter working for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to show you some simple examples of how LaTeX turns plain text into beautiful mathematical equations?\n",
    "\n",
    "As an engineering student, you'll be writing lots of technical documents with complex mathematical equations, figures, and references. While Microsoft Word is familiar, LaTeX is a much better choice for several key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perfect Mathematical Equations**: LaTeX renders beautiful, professional-grade equations that are consistent throughout your document. No more fighting with Word's equation editor!\n",
    "2. **Automatic Formatting**: Once you set up your document style, LaTeX handles all the formatting consistently - no more manually fixing spacing or numbering.\n",
    "3. **Superior Reference Management**: Citations, equations, figures, and sections are automatically numbered and cross-referenced, making it easy to update large documents.\n",
    "4. **Industry Standard**: LaTeX is widely used in scientific and engineering publications, making it a valuable skill for your career.\n",
    "5. **Free and Platform Independent**: Unlike Word, LaTeX is free and works identically across Windows, Mac, and Linux.\n",

    "# Steps to Create LaTeX Equations in JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open JupyterLab**\n",
    "   - Open your web browser\n",
    "   - Navigate to JupyterLab (usually at `localhost:8888` if installed locally)\n",
    "   - Click on the \"+\" button in the top left to create a new Launcher\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a New Notebook**\n",
    "   - In the Launcher, click on the \"Python 3\" icon under \"Notebook\"\n",
    "   - This creates a new `.ipynb` file\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add a Markdown Cell**\n",
    "   - Click the \"+\" button to add a new cell if needed\n",
    "   - Change the cell type from \"Code\" to \"Markdown\" using the dropdown menu in the toolbar\n",
    "   - Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut `M` while the cell is selected\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Enter Content**\n",
    "   - Copy and paste this title and introduction:\n",
    "     ```markdown\n",
    "     # LaTeX Equations Examples\n",
    "     \n",
    "     This notebook demonstrates how to write LaTeX equations in Jupyter. LaTeX is perfect for writing complex mathematical formulas clearly and professionally.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Add the Equations**\n",
    "   - In the same or new markdown cell, paste the LaTeX code:\n",
    "     ```markdown\n",
    "     The famous Euler's equation:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     $e^{i\\pi} = -1$\n",
    "     \n",

    "     \n",
    "     \\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "     a + b = c \\\\\n",
    "     a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n",
    "     \\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Run the Cell**\n",
    "   - Click the \"Run\" button (play icon) in the toolbar\n",
    "   - Or use the keyboard shortcut `Shift + Enter`\n",
    "   - The markdown will render, showing your beautifully formatted equations\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Save Your Work**\n",
    "   - Click File → Save Notebook\n",
    "   - Or use `Ctrl + S` (`Cmd + S` on Mac)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for Success:**\n",
    "- Single dollar signs `$...$` are for inline equations (within text)\n",
    "- Double dollar signs `$$...$$` or environments like `\\begin{equation}` are for displayed equations\n",
    "- If your equation doesn't render correctly, check for missing brackets or dollar signs\n",
    "- Use the Preview feature (eye icon in toolbar) to see how your markdown looks before running the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail or provide additional LaTeX equation examples that are commonly used in mechanical engineering?"

    "\n",
    "When you're writing notes by hand, it's easy to get sloppy with mathematical notation - and in engineering,\n",
    "this can lead to serious confusion! Think about vectors and scalars, for instance. In handwriting,\n",
    "students often forget or inconsistently use the little arrow or bold notation above vector quantities.\n",
    "One minute you're writing **F** for force as a vector, the next it's just F, and suddenly you're\n",
    "mixing up scalar and vector quantities without realizing it.\n",

    "vector using commands like `\\vec{F}` or `\\mathbf{F}`, which produces a clear, consistent vector notation\n",
    "($\\vec{F}$ or $\\mathbf{F}$, respectively). You can't accidentally \"forget\" the vector notation\n",
    "because the command must be there for it to appear- this makes a huge difference to me as a teacher as it\n",
    "makes me wonder if students even know what a vector is! This explicit nature of LaTeX helps reinforce\n",
    "proper mathematical notation and, more importantly, proper thinking about what quantities actually are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common handwriting mistakes that LaTeX prevents:\n",
    "- Ambiguous Greek letters (is that α or a?)\n",
    "- Inconsistent vector notation (sometimes with arrows, sometimes without)\n",
    "- Unclear subscripts and superscripts (is that x₂ or x_z?)\n",
    "- Messy fractions that make denominators and numerators unclear\n",
    "- Partial derivatives that look like regular d's\n",
    "\n",
    "With LaTeX, these all become crystal clear because you're using specific commands:\n",
    "```latex\n",
    "\\alpha \\neq a           % Clear distinction between Greek and Latin letters\n",
    "\\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}     % Consistently marked vectors\n",
    "x_{2} \\text{ or } x_{z}  % Unambiguous subscripts\n",

    "\\partial f/\\partial x   % Distinct partial derivative notation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This precision isn't just about looking professional - it's about developing good habits in how you think about and communicate engineering concepts. When you have to explicitly declare whether something is a vector, a scalar, or a tensor, you're forced to think more carefully about the mathematical nature of what you're working with!"
