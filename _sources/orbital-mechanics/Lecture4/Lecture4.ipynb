    "In {numref}`L4_fig1`, the semi-major axis ($a$) of the orbital ellipse is equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle. An additional angle, called the **eccentric anomaly** ($E$), is introduced. Similar to the true anomaly ($\\theta$), $E$ is measured from the line of apsides and represents the angular position of the orbiting body as it would appear projected onto the reference circle.  From this diagram, the following geometrical relationships can be derived:\n",
