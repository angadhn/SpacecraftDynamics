    "Much like how the translational dynamics inherently makes use of the concepts of linear momentum and forces, the rotational dynamics can be studied by making use of angular momentum (moment of linear momentum) and moments of forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next section, we will derive the relevant equations by making use of the system of particles from before (also shown in figure below). We also introduce a point $O$ as we know that the concept of a moment of a vector is defined relative to some point in space.\n",

    "The topics covered up until this point are briefly summarised in this section as a refresher to help with understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by examining the equations of motion of a single particle $P$ by Newton’s second law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{{F}} = m^N\\mathbf{{a}}^p\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we looked at a system of two particles and used that as a stepping stone towards deriving a generalised Newton’s second law for a system of any number of particles. This resulted in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{{F}} = m{}^N\\mathbf{{a}}^{S^*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{{F}}$ is the resultant force on the system,\n",
    "- $m$ is the total mass,\n",
    "- ${}^N\\mathbf{{a}}^{S^*}$ is the acceleration of the mass centre.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then used the generalized Newton’s second law to derive the rotational dynamics of the system relative to a frame $N$ by taking the moment of the translational motion about some arbitrary point $O$. The equations for rotational motion were then found to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum{\\mathbf{{M}}}^{{{\\mathbf{{F}}}_i}/{O}} = \\frac{{}^N d} {\\mathrm{d}t} {}^{N}{\\mathbf{{H}}}^{S/O} - \\left(m {}^{N}{\\mathbf{{v}}}^{S^*}\\right) \\times {}^{N}{\\mathbf{{v}}}^{O}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\sum{\\mathbf{{M}}}^{{{\\mathbf{{F}}}_i}/{O}}$ is the sum of moments from external forces,\n",
    "- $\\frac{{}^N d} {\\mathrm{d}t} {}^{N}{\\mathbf{{H}}}^{S/O}$ is the rate of change of ${\\mathbf{{H}}}$ of $S$ about $O$. \n",
    "As this rotational equation was derived from the generalized Newton’s law, this result is also general. By that, we mean that this applies to general 3D rotational motion of a system of particles, $S$, relative to an inertial frame, $N$. Therefore, it can be easily used to study more specific types of planar motion (e.g., rotation about a fixed axis and general plane motion) by starting from this general set of equations and applying appropriate analysis to the given problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we saw that the above equation simplifies when the point $O$ is either:\n",
    "* **case 1**: a point that is fixed in an inertial frame; and/or\n",
    "* **case 2**: the mass centre.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the last term involving cross products on the right-end side of the rotational equation drop out."
