    "## Introduction To Kinetics\n",
    "You may recall that dynamics was principally divided into two key parts: __kinematics__ and __kinetics__. If you've followed along this far, here's a recap of our journey:\n",
    "  1. We have already examined kinematics in some detail. One must pause to take note here that, in this case, motion was investigated without considering the forces causing it.\n",
    "  2. Then, we introduced concepts such as mass/inertia scalars.\n",
    "  3. Next we focused on forces; moments; and the various types of momenta.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This leads up to the final act: __kinetics__, which is the piece of the puzzle that relates the causes of motion (forces and moments) to the bodies. The law that connects them is one that you are likely already familiar with - Newton's Second Law. Quite simply put, this law states that the acceleration of a particle $P$ (for now, denoted as $\\mathbf{a}$) is directly proportional to the force $\\mathbf{F}$ acting on it. One may have also seen this law written as the following equation:\n",

    ":label: dynamics1_NewtonsLawBasic\n",
    "{\\mathbf F} = m{\\mathbf a}\n",

    "  \n",
    "In the following discussion, we dive deeper into this equation. A keen reader of this text may have already taken note that the vectors written here are incomplete when compared to our approach so far, i.e., our typical vector notations make use of super-scripts (and subscripts, in some cases) to specify reference frames, particles, bodies, etc. \n",
    "  \n",
    "<!--   This is what we will expound on that permits us to precisely -->\n",
    "<!--   define the dynamics in a manner consistent with what we have followed so far. -->\n",

    "(content:the-inertial-frame)=\n",
    "## Key Concept: The Inertial Frame\n",
    "In our discussions within kinematics, we have described positions in space of objects (i.e., points and reference frames) relative to some other reference frame by means of linear and angular measurements. In many cases, we made use of reference frames that were fixed (i.e., the ground).\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton’s laws of mechanics are valid in a frame known as an **inertial reference frame** (or **inertial frame** or **Newtonian frame**).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition 1**: Textbooks often define something known as a primary inertial system, which is a reference frame that is neither translating nor rotating in space. The laws of Newton are said to hold in this frame; experiments show that the laws are valid in such a frame as long as the velocities involved are negligible compared with the speed of light, which is 300,000 km/s. Consequently, for several engineering problems, the Earth can be approximated to an inertial frame in studying the motion of objects moving on it (like cars) and close to it (spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition 2**: It is also seen that Newton’s laws hold in any non-rotating reference frame that moves with a constant velocity; the time derivative of a constant velocity leads to zero acceleration. Thus, another definition emerges for an inertial frame as a frame which has zero acceleration (or is a non-accelerating reference frame).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the two definitions above, you will also commonly see books define an inertial frame in a rather circuitous manner as a frame in which Newton’s second law is valid. Now you know why.\n",
